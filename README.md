My personal answers for CSSBattle

I choose not to use SVG paths in my answers since I find it more interesting to solve with other CSS code.

Tips:
* https://cssbattle.dev/tips/
* Use short, invalid tags like c, d, e, f, etc. to save space
* `px` can be omitted for width, height, left, right, top, and bottom values, since the browser will be in Quirk Mode
* `in` is the most powerful unit, 9in can be used when you want a huge value that requires a unit
* `q` (quarter millimeter) is the shortest unit suffix, for when it cannot be omitted and when the size is small
* `%` values may be squished together, such as `clip-path:inset(0 0 50%0)` (no space between 50% and 0)
* Functions don't need to be closed when at the end of a file: `transform:scaleX(-1` can be the end of a file without the closing `)` or `}`.
